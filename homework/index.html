      <pre>Interested in the application of software to solve problems ranging from an everyday level to complex enterprise issues. 
Recently enrolled in a full-stack developer course, I hope to step in a role that will challenge me and give me the opportunity
to grow myself by answering the needs of today and tomorrow. Relatable and a team player I strive to find and fill my niche
in a group whether it be supporting, spearheading innovation and change, or leading the organization and execution of the
groups purpose.

Always open to new perspective and rethinking concepts to reach new levels of potential I look forward to one day being attached to 
something that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier.
